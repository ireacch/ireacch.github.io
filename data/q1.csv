To see world-leading REF2021 subjects like History (2nd in the UK) being dismantled in half and other CSSAH/STEM subjects closing down does not inspire future confidence or current trust in research leadership. "

Everyone is expected to contribute more and more with little prospect of any kind of reward (beyond continued employment). The University continues to have a major issue with how senior management relates to (and fails to listen to) the general workforce. This may not be the greatest time for this question to be asked.

15,9/2/25 13:36:18,9/2/25 13:53:12,anonymous,,Extremely unvalued,"There is no clear promotion pathway, particularly for early career researchers (ECRs). Within the School and College, staff are under constant pressure to teach 4–5 modules throughout the year. Consequently, there is little to no time available for research, even though expectations for research output remain unreasonably high. These expectations are frequently used as criteria for performance reviews or probation assessments. In some cases, PDD or probation managers have even used the lack of research output as a threat to alter staff members’ original contracts.
Senior management shows little concern for addressing workload distribution through meaningful discussion. Instead, allocations are made merely to fill gaps, with little regard for fairness or staff mental health and well-being. On many occasions, workload allocation models have been recorded inaccurately by the Head or Deputy Head of School—for example, omitting early career researcher (ECR) allowances. Furthermore, no checking mechanism has been put in place to ensure accuracy or accountability."

A team/School/College/institution is made up of individuals, and individuals can all affect the research culture in which you work, in different ways. It can also be time dependent - there's a lot going on with the strategic review and, although I'm not directly affected, I have colleagues who are, and so the mood (and how valued people feel) is greatly impacted at the moment. It makes me wonder how valued any of us are - even though I understand the logic and hence the need for the strategic review - it can have either a direct or an indirect effect on how valued someone feels."

This was communicated via email. Apparently, HR were unaware that a PIP conveys a last resort for underperforming staff prior to termination. It's very cold and wildly inappropriate. These letters showed no recognition that staff aims need to flex in relation to school needs and are not always a choice. No details were given about what support is to be provided. How are we supposed to feel valued in those circumstances?"

47,9/12/25 14:10:50,9/12/25 15:04:42,anonymous,,Not sure,I feel highly valued by my immediate group level colleagues but not by the University as a whole as there is no evident effort to shield research staff from precarity of employment which makes any planning of career or life in general almost impossible and leaves many sitting on the edge of redundancy for years. I suggest this attitude is short-sighted as the active researchers are the engine that deliver all the marketed headline promises of research output and excellence - in fact I'd suggest this leaves the University itself in a precarious situation as if such staff are lost they will be irreplaceable given their long years of experience in specialised areas (such as Space science) that once lost would lose us our competitive edge in these research areas. Giving research staff stable career prospects should be seen as an essential investment as important as investing in physical infrastructure such as SPL.
