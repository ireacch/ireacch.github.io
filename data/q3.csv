For example, regarding equipment available, or possibility to get equipment for experimental work. Also regarding opportunities to get a PhD student - it is extremely difficult at Leicester to get a PhD student compared to my previous university, and in 3 years I did not manage to secure one (even when I was successful in getting a PhD project within internal programmes, the recruitment process is so competitive and opaque that I did not manage to get a student on the projects)."

26,9/17/25 10:41:47,9/17/25 10:56:25,anonymous,,Extremely not aligned,"The university has created a hostage situation of a (teaching &) research culture with those who can escape the University looking to do so. Those who are left behind see their workload increase to cover the gaps. Morale isn't just low, it's nonexistent. Those who prioritise research throw their colleagues under the bus, they ask for teaching cover, or generally don't reply to student emails. Those who are trying to develop a research agenda can only do so if the department has colleagues interested in that specific area, and if those colleagues are supportive, anything that doesn't conform to already established practices has an uphill battle. It's not a meritocracy; most of us are looking for jobs elsewhere, so why would we go over backwards to develop a research project when half the staff are likely to have left. Our research budgets are slashed to the point where we regularly pay for conferences out of our own pocket (or simply don't bother looking at them) we get letters saying that our study leave is subject to requirements of the University (making it all seem a bit pointless if our time isn't actually protected to do research) and the University fails to recognise that research impact/development of substantive research is incremental and achieved in short spurts before longer sprints. In short, the University makes it very clear that it cares about 'high flyers' but only if they come to the University already flying high, not about those who are held back through the appalling work environment here. Mentorship is a joke, research support is a joke, I get more help from friends at other Universities than I do from my (CSSAH) dept. At interviews we're so careful not to promise or say anything lest there be repercussions; it's a performance on both sides. Remove the college system, we've fewer Schools now, we don't need it. Get dedicated press teams for each school (not just the college) to help develop wider dissemination (and student recruitment I guess) and remove the one-size-fits-all approach that only serves to reinforce the college's existence. Colleagues regularly and openly talk about their draft resignation letters, about jobs going at other institutions, and about the poor college and exec level management. We know we're not cared about in CSSAH. We know we're just there to recruit students. "

I find it disappointing that it is so difficult to review JSFs in the uni as it always seems to be a huge battle either if trying to get regraded, or even just adjust, therefore after a little while, the JSF becomes very obsolete. With the restructure as well, there will be nothing done to ensure that JSFs now align with the expectations of the restructure, which means as a manager, I have to manage that locally with no support.
