Giving research staff stable career prospects should be seen as an essential investment as important as investing in physical infrastructure such as SPL. 
Research output will ultimately benefit if research staff are given the confidence of more continuous employment to enable them to take a long term view in developing collaborations and proposals rather than having to make short-term hops between available sources of funding."
